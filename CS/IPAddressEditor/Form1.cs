// Developer Express Code Central Example:
// How to create an IP address editor with the capability of cycling through every part of an IP address
// 
// If you need an IP address editor with a spin edit capable to change values in
// cycle from 0 to 255 for every single part of an IP address this example explains
// how to obtain it. This editor corresponds to a descendant of the TimeEdit
// control and its behavior is based on storing an IP address as a value of type
// DateTime. The IP address is simply transformed to a value of type Int64 and
// assigned to the Ticks property of the DateTime value. The ability to cycle
// through IP address parts is achieved by assigning a mask of type "d.h.m.s" (Day,
// Hour, Minute, Second) and changing the low and high cycle bounds in theTimeEdit
// descendant to 0 and 255 respectively.
//
