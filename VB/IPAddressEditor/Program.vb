' How to create an IP address editor with the capability of cycling through every part of an IP address
' 
' If you need an IP address editor with a spin edit capable to change values in
' cycle from 0 to 255 for every single part of an IP address this example explains
' how to obtain it. This editor corresponds to a descendant of the TimeEdit
' control and its behavior is based on storing an IP address as a value of type
' DateTime. The IP address is simply transformed to a value of type Int64 and
' assigned to the Ticks property of the DateTime value. The ability to cycle
' through IP address parts is achieved by assigning a mask of type "d.h.m.s" (Day,
' Hour, Minute, Second) and changing the low and high cycle bounds in theTimeEdit
' descendant to 0 and 255 respectively.
'
